    <input>gv kkk</input> DC machine can be <mark>hari krishanan</mark>classified into two types namely
 DC motors as well as DC generators. Most of the DC machines are equivalent to AC machines because 
 they include AC currents as well as AC voltages in them. The output of the DC machine is DC output because
  they convert <img></img> voltage to DC voltage. <br></br>The conversion of this mechanism is known as the commutator, thus
   these machines are also named as commutating machines. DC machine is most frequently used for a motor. 
   The main benefits of this machine include torque regulation as well as easy speed. The applications of 
   the DC machine is limited to trains, mills, and mines. For example, underground subway cars, as well as 
   trolleys, may utilize DC motors. In the past, automobiles were designed with DC dynamos for charging their batteries.
